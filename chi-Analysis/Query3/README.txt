QUERY 3 :Intersect parameters from multiple datasets: Create a graph that plot crime statistics for each age group by census block. Year | Census Block | Age Group | Crime Type | #CrimesNote:1. The results computed are only for the year 2010. The results will work provided the data for other years.How to run:1. Navigate to the folder 'Query3' from command line. 'Crime Age' folder contains all the scripts and initial files required for this task.2. Use the following command :	python3 scriptGetBlock.py [Crimes2010.csv]where [Crimes2010.csv] is the default input file in the folder. Can be replaced with any file containing crimes data with following mandatory fields (ensure field/column names are as specified): ID, Primary Type, Community Area, Arrest, Year, Latitude, LongitudeThe scriptGetBlock.py  will take [Crimes2010.csv] as input and generate a file named 'Crimes.csv' which contains Census Tract and Block information for all the crimes in the input file.NOTE: The script is set to generate census block data for a random sample of size 5000 from the input file (owing to the large size of Crime data). However, the script will work for the large crime data as well but will take longer to produce the results. If another input file is used than it has to be ensured that it contains at least 5000 rows of data.3. Once the 'Crimes.csv' file is generated (by Step#2), use the following command(ensure that 'Crimes.csv' generated in Step#2 is in same folder as the script):	python3 crimeAge.py [AgeGroup2010.csv] where [AgeGroup2010.csv] is the default input file in folder containing the age group data for year 2010. It can be replaced with any file with following mandatory fields(ensure field/column names are as specified):'FIPS','Tract','0to9','10to19','20to29','30to39','40to49','50to59','60to69','70to79','over80','total'crimeAge.py script will take the file [AgeGroup2010.csv] and the Crimes.csv is the file generated in Step#2(ensure that it is in same folder as the script)  and will produce the results in the file 'Query3_Results.csv'The output files contain the following fields: Year | Census Tract | AgeGroup | AgeGroupPopulation | Crime Type | #CrimesNOTE: For this task grouping has been done on the basis of Census Tract rather than combination of CensusTract and Block because otherwise considering the sampled crime data, number of crimes in the output file varies only in the range of 1 to 7. To make output data more reasonable, it was grouped by CensusTract.
