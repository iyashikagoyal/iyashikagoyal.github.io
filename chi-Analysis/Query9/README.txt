QUERY 9: Does having a liquor license influence crime incidents in the neighborhood?  Census Block | #Businesses with liquor licenses | #Crimes | #Arrests 
Download the crimes dataset from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11psZu0BDaX_7xZnDBb_DW7xsOhUOG_Qi/view?usp=sharing and save it in this directory. (You can also use the file in the crime_classification folder in the root directory)
Use the name of this downloaded file in Step#3
How to run:1.  Navigate to the folder 'Query9' from command line. This folder contains all the scripts and files required for this task.2. Use the following command:	python3 scriptGetBlockForBizLicense.py [Business_Licenses.csv]where [Business_Licenses.csv] is the default input file in the folder. It can be replaced with any file containing business licenses data with following mandatory fields (ensure field/column names are as specified):'License Id','Account Number','Legal Name','Address','License Code','License Description','Latitude','Longitude'The scriptGetBlockForBizLicense.py will generate census blocks for the input file and output the results in the file 'LiquorLicenses.csv'.3. Once the 'LiquorLicenses.csv' is generated (by Step#2)(ensure the file is in same folder as script), use the following command:	python3 LiquorCrimeInfluence.py [Crimes_2001_to_present.csv]where [Crimes_2001_to_present.csv](replace with downloaded file name) or Can be replaced with any file containing crimes data with following mandatory fields (ensure field/column names are as specified): 'ID','Arrest','Latitude','Longitude'The script LiquorCrimeInfluence.py will take the file [Crimes_2001_to_present.csv] and file 'LiquorLicenses.csv' generated in Step#2 and produce results in file 'Query9_Results.csv'NOTE: The script is set to generate census block data for a random sample of size 5000 from the input file (owing to the large size of Crime data). However, the script will work for the large crime data as well but will take longer to produce the results. If another input file is used than it has to be ensured that it contains at least 5000 rows of data.
